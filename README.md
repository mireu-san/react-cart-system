# Abstract
To test out whether it works with the following stack combination:
- react.js, react-query, react-router-dom, redux

HOWEVER, I will not implement Redux till I complete the objectives.


# Objective
To build a simple cart system, and login auth system. Total : 2.

# How each file work (temporary)
- index.js ✅
This page will pop up initially.

- App.js ✅
A main page to handle everything. 
May load 'react-router-dom' 'routes' here.

in components: ✅ (if necessary) react-router-dom
- Navbar.jsx (either use css or styled-components)

# Not defined (temporary)
in context: react-query
- shop-context.jsx

in pages: react-query
cart - cart-item.jsx, cart.jsx (either use css or styled-components)
shop - product.jsx, shop.jsx (either use css or styled-comp.)
contact.jsx

# Understanding of each tech stack
- react-query:
fetching then caching data, so api call will be reduced and server can burden off?
Answer: https://tech.osci.kr/2022/07/13/react-query/

- So, server side for react-query. client side is for Redux.
